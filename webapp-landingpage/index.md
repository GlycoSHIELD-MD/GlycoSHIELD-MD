## Web application usage hints

Please **quit the web application by clicking the button** on the left before
leaving it to free resources for other users.

Please note that the Cloud environment that hosts the interactive web
application has **limited resources** and might not be able to handle large
setups.  In that case, we advise users to use a powerful local workstation on
HPC resources.

Moreover, please note that the Cloud session is completely ephemeral, and **all
files will be deleted** after its termination. If necessary, download a Zip
archive with your data which is offered by the web GUI.
